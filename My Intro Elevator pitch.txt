Hi, my name is Tanoy Saha. I’m from Agartala, Tripura, and currently living in Bangalore. I recently completed my MCA from NMIT Bangalore, and previously I have done my BCA from ICFAI University Tripura. I have a strong interest in automation testing and have completed a certification in this field. During my learning journey, I worked on projects like automating an e-commerce website using Java and Selenium, building test scripts for a Human Resource Management Portal, and performing API testing for a Contact List application. I'm skilled in tools like Selenium WebDriver, Playwright, Cypress, and have experience with CI/CD tools like Jenkins and version control with Git and GitHub. I’m passionate about improving software quality through automation and always open to learning new tools and techniques to stay updated. I'm now looking for an opportunity where I can contribute as an automation tester and grow in a dynamic team.
